# iDempiere Examples Repository

Welcome to the iDempiere Examples Repository! This repository contains a collection of examples and best practices for writing code and plugins for the iDempiere ERP system. Whether you are new to iDempiere or an experienced developer, these examples will help you understand how to extend and customize iDempiere to meet your business needs.

## Purpose

The purpose of these examples is to help with the following:

- Offer you a quick start option to get something up and running quickly. You should be able to copy an existing directory into your project and make use of it as-is.
- Demonstrate current best practices for a given interface. Over the last 13+ years, the method by which you code against an interface has evolved.
- Create consistency within a team of developers. There are times when you need a team to create plugins in a current and consistent way. This repository makes it easy to establish practices per team and/or per project.

## Creating New Plugins in Principle
When speaking with @carlosruiz, his practice is to:

1. Look for a similar plugin in an existing project to copy, modify and deploy.
1. If no local examples exist, use the examples in this repository as the starting point. 

## Getting Started
1. clone this repository locally
1. copy the desired example into your project
1. use this page as a guide to determine what files need to change and to get your plugin running: https://wiki.idempiere.org/en/Developing_Plug-Ins_-_Get_your_Plug-In_running
1. To ensure all files have changed, search the plugin for the term "example".
1. Modify the example class according to your needs.
